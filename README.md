This is an old code, which I'll leave in Git so I do not have it wandering around, there is an example video where you see several things of the engine;

• Support for Windows XP, using OpenGL 2.0.

• A simple core of game-engine.

• Camera using quaternions. (in revision)

• SkyBox.

• Terrain.

• Level of detail (Geomorphing/geomipmap using Boer's Algorithm).

• A simple shader manager.

• Skeletal animation (MD5 struct).

• Terrain collision with interpolation and baryCentric alignment.

• Frustum culling.

• A simple Octree and AABB data-manage of big scene.
